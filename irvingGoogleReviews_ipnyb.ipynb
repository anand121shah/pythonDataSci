Couldn't go inside due to the doors being locked, Please get this addressed! Plus the neighborhood isn't safe and the class of the neighborhood greatly reflects on the bank. There's homeless people and pan handlers in the parking lot harassing people for money going in and out of the bank.

Plus the parking lot is filled with potholes especially trying to pull up to the ATM Drive-thru from Irving Boulevard. I do not feel safe at this establishment.\n",

Also, the business advantage employee was doing nothing in her office the whole time.  Looking at her phone.  Bad management at this location. If there is a constant line of 15-20 people, have the bank staffed to handle it and move people along.\n",

However we do use services inside the bank and it is bad. We have been with this bank ( many name changes) since 1971. That probably puts us in a group of longest time customers. We are now searching for a new bank. Regrettable.\n",

But the thing that made me really uncomfortable was the woman in front of me (AAPI) in line told the staff she wanted to open a bank account for her son (a minor). They said OK! And let her wait in line.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, a white woman comes in with her daughter and sort of bucks the line by standing to the side and making a big stink. She said she wanted to open an account for her daughter, they said all the bankers are fully booked today and she had to go online to make an appointment. She said “I’ve tried calling every Bank of America in Irving and no one answers their phones.” So one of the tellers offered to help her open one, effectively cutting 3 people in line (some of whom, like I mentioned, were waiting for the same service).\n",
            "\n",
            "AFTER ALL THIS and after like 20 minutes of waiting, a staff member returned to the AAPI woman and let her know she couldn’t open an account without her son present. I’ve never heard of this rule and can’t find it anywhere online, and also wonder why they waited like 30 minutes to tell her this, conveniently IMMEDIATELY after they let someone cut in front of her to receive the precise same service. Felt very much like an “oh no, we have to save some face” moment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, there were other bankers walking around chatting with people who could have helped either of them, instead of one of the tellers going out of commission and letting the line back up (most of us came in close to an hour before closing, and left close to closing).\n",

When I approached the window, she was asking for the same documents twice and didn’t seem to be able to follow the flow of conversation easily. Though she was a teller, she actually had no idea how to process the transaction that I asked for and had to repeatedly ask for help. She was very nice but the entire process was completely inefficient and a waste of time. I ended up going to a bank down the street and completing the transaction in 10 minutes total, after having wasted over 30 minutes in this branch because they do not know how to complete simple financial transactions.\n",

Every time I visit a branch, nobody greets me or acknowledges that there is a customer in the lobby. It takes 10-15 minutes for a teller line to open up to talk to a person. The best part, the teller tells me to talk to a personal banker who happened to walk by me at least 3 times whilst I was waiting in the lobby. I cannot wait to close all my accounts and leave this banking institution.\n",

The far right one was being worked on and the far left machine WASN'T MARKED OUT OF ORDER and wouldn't accept cards. Long line of cars waiting for the middle and ONLY working ATM machine. Couldn't go inside due to the doors being locked, Please get this addressed! Plus the neighborhood isn't safe and the class of the neighborhood greatly reflects on the bank. There's homeless people and pan handlers in the parking lot harassing people for money going in and out of the bank. Plus the parking lot is filled with potholes especially trying to pull up to the ATM Drive-thru from Irving Boulevard. I do not feel safe at this establishment.\n",

However we do use services inside the bank and it is bad. We have been with this bank ( many name changes) since 1971. That probably puts us in a group of longest time customers.

But the thing that made me really uncomfortable was the woman in front of me (AAPI) in line told the staff she wanted to open a bank account for her son (a minor). They said OK! And let her wait in line.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, a white woman comes in with her daughter and sort of bucks the line by standing to the side and making a big stink. She said she wanted to open an account for her daughter, they said all the bankers are fully booked today and she had to go online to make an appointment. She said “I’ve tried calling every Bank of America in Irving and no one answers their phones.” So one of the tellers offered to help her open one, effectively cutting 3 people in line (some of whom, like I mentioned, were waiting for the same service).\n",
            "\n",
            "AFTER ALL THIS and after like 20 minutes of waiting, a staff member returned to the AAPI woman and let her know she couldn’t open an account without her son present. I’ve never heard of this rule and can’t find it anywhere online, and also wonder why they waited like 30 minutes to tell her this, conveniently IMMEDIATELY after they let someone cut in front of her to receive the precise same service. Felt very much like an “oh no, we have to save some face” moment.\n",

            "Also, there were other bankers walking around chatting with people who could have helped either of them, instead of one of the tellers going out of commission and letting the line back up (most of us came in close to an hour before closing, and left close to closing).\n",

Though she was a teller, she actually had no idea how to process the transaction that I asked for and had to repeatedly ask for help. She was very nice but the entire process was completely inefficient and a waste of time. I ended up going to a bank down the street and completing the transaction in 10 minutes total, after having wasted over 30 minutes in this branch because they do not know how to complete simple financial transactions.\n",

The tellers are wonderful but Bank of America needs to change their ways. I have not felt good walking into any Bank of America branches in the past 5 years or so. I usually have deposits only, long wait times, and tellers don't seem to bear the smiles, it seems like they are unhappy working there.\n",

This was the worst banking center experience I have ever gone through. You have to make an appt but this is what’s going on instead of opening new accounts\n",

Every time I visit a branch, nobody greets me or acknowledges that there is a customer in the lobby. It takes 10-15 minutes for a teller line to open up to talk to a person. The best part, the teller tells me to talk to a personal banker who happened to walk by me at least 3 times whilst I was waiting in the lobby. I cannot wait to close all my accounts and leave this banking institution.\n",

She continually asked if I had a signon. I told her that I exited the system too soon and failed to create online registration. So she gave me my acct number and told me to get in line. So at the counter, the gentleman was asking questions. He wanted to know if I wanted a temporary card until mine arrived. He directed me back to the Chinese lady that REFUSED to help me???. She told the teller that will be receiving my card Thursday (I guess she works for the postal service too). She refused to help me and this other lady that was in line. She walked by us 4 times. Maybe she should have stayed home or found another job that she is happy with.\n",

The far right one was being worked on and the far left machine WASN'T MARKED OUT OF ORDER and wouldn't accept cards. Long line of cars waiting for the middle and ONLY working ATM machine. Couldn't go inside due to the doors being locked, Please get this addressed! Plus the neighborhood isn't safe and the class of the neighborhood greatly reflects on the bank. There's homeless people and pan handlers in the parking lot harassing people for money going in and out of the bank. Plus the parking lot is filled with potholes especially trying to pull up to the ATM Drive-thru from Irving Boulevard. I do not feel safe at this establishment.\n",

She said “I’ve tried calling every Bank of America in Irving and no one answers their phones.” So one of the tellers offered to help her open one, effectively cutting 3 people in line (some of whom, like I mentioned, were waiting for the same service).\n",

The far right one was being worked on and the far left machine WASN'T MARKED OUT OF ORDER and wouldn't accept cards. Long line of cars waiting for the middle and ONLY working ATM machine. Couldn't go inside due to the doors being locked, Please get this addressed! Plus the neighborhood isn't safe and the class of the neighborhood greatly reflects on the bank. There's homeless people and pan handlers in the parking lot harassing people for money going in and out of the bank. Plus the parking lot is filled with potholes especially trying to pull up to the ATM Drive-thru from Irving Boulevard. I do not feel safe at this establishment.\n",

The worst part about it is after she said I couldn’t deposit my check, I did a mobile deposit and it went through the same day; so I know she was lying when she gave me the lame excuse as to why I was not able to deposit my check. Looking for another place to bank as I type this. Can’t support a racist institution.\n",

The far right one was being worked on and the far left machine WASN'T MARKED OUT OF ORDER and wouldn't accept cards. Long line of cars waiting for the middle and ONLY working ATM machine. Couldn't go inside due to the doors being locked, Please get this addressed! Plus the neighborhood isn't safe and the class of the neighborhood greatly reflects on the bank. There's homeless people and pan handlers in the parking lot harassing people for money going in and out of the bank. Plus the parking lot is filled with potholes especially trying to pull up to the ATM Drive-thru from Irving Boulevard. I do not feel safe at this establishment.\n",

I can safely say that BofA does NOT care about customer service. Every time I visit a branch, nobody greets me or acknowledges that there is a customer in the lobby. It takes 10-15 minutes for a teller line to open up to talk to a person. The best part, the teller tells me to talk to a personal banker who happened to walk by me at least 3 times whilst I was waiting in the lobby. I cannot wait to close all my accounts and leave this banking institution.\n",
